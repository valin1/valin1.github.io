I currently work as a software engineer on the Play Ads Quality team at Google. Previously, I received a BA in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) (go bears!). 

In the past, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in Berkeley's [RISE Lab](https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/) with [Alvin Cheung](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/) on video database systems and with [N. Benjamin Erichson](https://www.benerichson.com/) and [Michael Mahoney](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/) on robust dynamical systems based on neural network architectures. I have also worked with K. Shankari, [David Culler](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~culler/) and [Randy Katz](https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/randy-h-katz) on a recommendation system promoting better sustainable transportation habits. 

Sometimes, you can catch me editing clips to become a mediocre vlogger, learning dance choreographies, or scoping out some good songs (I don't know what genre I like anymore).
