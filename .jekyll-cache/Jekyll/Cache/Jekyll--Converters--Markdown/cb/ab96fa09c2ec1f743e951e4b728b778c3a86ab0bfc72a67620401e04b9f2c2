I"i<p>I currently work as a software engineer on the Play Ads Quality team at Google. Previously, I received a BA in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics from <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a> (go bears!).</p>

<p>In the past, I worked as an undergraduate researcher in Berkeley’s <a href="https://rise.cs.berkeley.edu/">RISE Lab</a> with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~akcheung/">Alvin Cheung</a> on video database systems and with <a href="https://www.benerichson.com/">N. Benjamin Erichson</a> and <a href="https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~mmahoney/">Michael Mahoney</a> on robust dynamical systems based on neural network architectures. I have also worked with K. Shankari, <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~culler/">David Culler</a> and <a href="https://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/randy-h-katz">Randy Katz</a> on a recommendation system promoting better sustainable transportation habits.</p>

<p>Sometimes, you can catch me editing clips to become a mediocre vlogger, learning dance choreographies, or scoping out some good songs (I don’t know what genre I like anymore).</p>
